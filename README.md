# assetMap

Simple google map with clustering assets fiddle

Purpose of this exercise is to determine a fast and reliable clustering mechanic that can compute
large quantities of markers seemingly. Clusters should provide the user with information regarding
all the markers that it is composed of.

## Installation:

1. Node.js is required, so please make sure it is installed on your machine.

If node.js is not installed you can donwload and install it from here (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
For comparation purposes I am using v6.9.4 (though I try to keep up with their latest)

Note: You can check whether node.js is installed by running node -v in your command line preffered program

2. in the repository root folder you have to run `npm install`. You can also run `npm run installAndBuild`
which is a little shortcut I left there to skip step 3.

3. After all the dependencies have been installed all that is left is to build the project by running
`npm run build`. A dist folder should have been created in the repository folder containing 1 index.html
file, two js files and one assets folder.

4. Open the index.html file in your favorite browser to check out this little project.
